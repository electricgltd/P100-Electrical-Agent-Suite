##Devcontainer (deterministic & simple)
**Design principles**
- Project code (incl. Python modules) lives in the repo (e.g., tools/), not inside .venv/.
- The container builds from a known image; postCreate creates the venv and installs deps.
- VS Code points to the in‚Äëcontainer interpreter; paths are workspace‚Äërelative.
**Files to add (minimal)**
**devcontainer/devcontainer.json**
**Why this fixes your issue**
- Your Python file is in tools/ (repo), not lost inside a venv.
- The venv is created after the container builds, so the interpreter exists and VS Code can bind to it.
- .dotnet/tools is on PATH so pac is available if you choose to use it later (no PowerShell required).
Keep any Python entrypoints under tools/ (or similar). In tasks/launch, call them with ${workspaceFolder}/.venv/bin/python tools/your_script.py.
##Solution Checker (minimal GitHub Action)
**Goal:** run Solution Checker on PRs and show results in PR.
**Approach (concise)**
- Use the official Microsoft Power Platform Actions ‚Äúcheck solution‚Äù step within a simple workflow.
- Inputs: environment URL and your AAD app credentials via GitHub Secrets (names only).
- Gate merges on severity threshold; add a DoD checkbox ‚ÄúSolution Checker green or waivers recorded.‚Äù
**Skeleton workflow (YAML)**
**Notes**
- Ensure your nightly/PR export creates/updates the zip at the path above (or point to your actual zip).
- Add to PR template: ‚ÄúSolution Checker: ‚úÖ/üõë (link to logs).‚Äù
- This complements CodeQL, keeping ALM governance visible in PRS
##‚ÄúContext Pack Builder‚Äù (what it is, fast manual method)
**Definition:** a tiny one‚Äëpager per work slice that unifies grounding for you, reviewers, and both Copilots.
Where: grounding-files/<issue-id>-context-pack.md or a SharePoint library (see EDP below).
**Template (copy/paste):**
# Context Pack ‚Äî <Issue # / Title>
Links: GitHub Issue ‚Ä¶ | Planner ‚Ä¶ 
Acceptance Criteria:
- AC‚Äë1 ‚Ä¶
- AC‚Äë2 ‚Ä¶
Definition of Done:
- DoD‚Äë1 ‚Ä¶
Scope Guardrails: allowed folders ‚Ä¶ ; out of scope ‚Ä¶
Relevant Schema: links to schema_snapshots/‚Ä¶ and brief notes
Required Checks: CodeQL (Y/N), Solution Checker (Y/N), other ‚Ä¶
##Enterprise Data Protection (EDP) grounding
Save down in OneDrive
##Ops feedback loop (tiny and effective)
Create ops-log.md (repo or SharePoint). For each failing run: paste the first failing error line, your hypothesis, and the minimal fix you tried. It becomes your searchable memory for auth, runner, and path issues
