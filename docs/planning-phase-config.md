# Planning Phase Configuration

This document outlines the planning phase implementation including Project v2 fields, labels, and workflow configurations.

## Project v2 Single-Select Fields

The following structured fields should be configured in GitHub Project #2:

### Planning Status (Single Select)
- **Not Started** - Planning phase not yet begun
- **In Progress** - Actively planning and creating sub-issues
- **Review** - Planning complete, awaiting review
- **Approved** - Planning approved, execution can begin  
- **Done** - Planning phase completed

### Agent Authorization (Single Select)
- **Not Required** - No agent work needed for this issue
- **Pending** - Agent work requested but not yet authorized
- **Allowed** - Agent work authorized and can proceed
- **In Progress** - Agent is currently working on this issue
- **Complete** - Agent work completed, pending human review
- **Approved** - Agent work reviewed and approved
- **Denied** - Agent work explicitly denied/blocked

### Planning Phase (Single Select)
- **Discovery** - Initial requirements gathering
- **Analysis** - Analyzing requirements and constraints
- **Design** - Creating solution design
- **Planning** - Breaking down into actionable tasks
- **Coordination** - Coordinating across agents/teams
- **Validation** - Validating plan before execution

## Label Combinations for Workflows

### Planning Phase Triggers
- `Planning` + `agent:PA` → Creates planning branch and coordination workflows
- `Planning` + `Critical` → Escalates to high-priority planning queue
- `Planning` + Area labels → Routes to appropriate specialist agents

### Agent Sub-issue Triggers
- `sub-issue` + `agent: allowed` → Enables automated agent processing
- `sub-issue` + `agent: denied` → Blocks all automated processing
- `agent: generated` → Marks PR as agent-created (requires human approval)
- `agent: approved` → Human has reviewed and approved agent work

### Workflow State Combinations
- `Planning` + `agent:PA` + Area labels → Full planning workflow activation
- `sub-issue` + `agent: allowed` + scope validation → Agent work pipeline
- `agent: generated` + `agent: approved` → Ready for merge

## Safety and Governance

### Required Approvals
- All agent-generated PRs must be reviewed by a human
- Planning phase issues require explicit approval before execution
- Sub-issues must have defined scope before agent authorization

### Audit Trail
- All agent commits include `[agent-generated]` marker
- PR descriptions include `AUTOGENERATED-BY-AGENT: true`
- Branch naming follows `agent/<issue>-<slug>` convention
- Safety checklist must be completed for all agent work

### Security Boundaries
- Agents limited to explicitly defined file scopes
- No access to secrets or sensitive configuration
- All changes subject to standard CI/CD pipeline
- Manual approval gate before any merge

## Integration Points

### OneDrive Integration
- Planning documents linked in issue templates
- Grounding files referenced for agent behavior
- Documentation templates for consistency

### Power Platform Integration  
- Planning phase data flows to Power Automate
- Dataverse integration for tracking and reporting
- Cross-platform coordination workflows

### GitHub Project Integration
- Automatic addition to Project #2
- Field population based on labels and content
- Progress tracking through planning phases
- Resource allocation and capacity planning
