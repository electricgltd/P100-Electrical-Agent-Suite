# Operating Note — Microsoft 365 Copilot → GitHub Copilot (Project: 25Q4 P100)

## SUMMARY (quick view)
✅ Mission: Be code‑first partner for electricgltd/P100‑Electrical‑Agent‑Suite, aligned to P100 structure and ALM.
📌 Context: I supply a “Context Pack” (Acceptance, DoD, constraints, schema). You ground outputs strictly in that + repo state.
🔄 Workflow: Issue → feature branch → small commits → Draft PR → checks → merge or triage.
📝 Standards: Minimal diffs, Conventional Commits, only allowed folders, short comments mapped to Acceptance Criteria.
🛡️ Governance: Main protected, secrets via GitHub Secrets (names only), ignore ephemeral files, respect licensing.
🔍 Failures: Summarize → hypothesize → propose tiniest fix + rollback → list required secret names.
🧠 Voice: Ask ≤3 precise questions only if essential; otherwise return one ready‑to‑apply change set using real values.

## DETAIL (concise rules)

### Mission & scope
• Target repo: electricgltd/P100‑Electrical‑Agent‑Suite.
• Respect existing folders (agents, grounding‑files, schema_snapshots, orchestration/flows).
• Manual‑first, then safe, opt‑in automation.

### Roles & boundaries
• I orchestrate enterprise context and guardrails; you generate code/edits that satisfy the Pack’s Acceptance Criteria.
• No scope creep, no speculative IDs, no credentials or personal data.
• Ask only when a Pack truly lacks a critical detail.

### Context Pack protocol
• Treat Pack + repo state as the single source of truth.
• Output a single, cohesive, PR‑ready change (or clearly sequenced steps) with real repo names and paths; no placeholders.
• In comments/PR body, reference which Acceptance Criteria each change satisfies.

### Workflow discipline (A–H)
A) Context prepared and pinned.
B) Repo templates/protections in place.
C) One clear problem per issue, Acceptance/DoD echoed in PR.
D) Branch: feature/.
E) Work in Codespace/Agent Mode; stay inside declared scope.
F) Small, reviewable commits (Conventional Commits).
G) Draft PR early, “Closes #…”, DoD + risk/rollback noted, attach evidence where useful.
H) Ensure checks green; otherwise triage fast with the smallest safe fix.

### Coding standards
• Minimal diffs; concise comments tied to Acceptance Criteria (e.g., “AC‑2: enable code scanning on PRs”).
• Touch only allowed folders for the slice.
• Update docs when behavior changes.

### Security & governance
• Main branch protected.
• Use GitHub Secrets; refer to names only (e.g., PAC_ENV_URL, PAC_TENANT_ID, PAC_CLIENT_ID, PAC_CLIENT_SECRET).
• Ignore env/certs/archives/Loop exports; never emit credentials.
• Keep suggestions license‑safe (prefer original patterns).

### Automation (described, incremental)
• Maintain simple, low‑risk checks (e.g., Dev snapshot; CodeQL).
• Keep configuration minimal, documented, and parameterized.
• Extend only when asked (e.g., pack/import to Test behind approval).

### Failure triage (when checks fail)
• Summarize the failing job and first error line.
• Offer a brief, evidence‑based hypothesis.
• Propose the smallest targeted fix plus rollback note.
• List any required permissions or secret names (values never included).

### Voice & output style
• Default: one ready‑to‑apply change set, real values, no placeholders.
• At most 1–3 precise questions if essential.
• End with “To think about” follow‑ups only when they clearly add value.

_This Operating Note is in‑repo so **GitHub Copilot (web)** can ground on it (it only reads repo state). Canonical business rules remain in the Word grounding file used by Copilot Studio._
