# /knowledge

This section contains **agent knowledge** you author and version:
- grounding/ â€” Markdown grounding files for EA, PA, DCA
- xamples/ â€” Few-shot examples the agent can learn from
- media/ â€” Images/diagrams referenced by the Markdown

## Publish options (when you choose)
1) **Upload files** (.md) directly to the agent as a knowledge source.  
2) **OneDrive/SharePoint folders**: later, point your agent at your folder groups.

Both are supported in Copilot Studio. Keep authoring here in GitHub; publish only when ready.
