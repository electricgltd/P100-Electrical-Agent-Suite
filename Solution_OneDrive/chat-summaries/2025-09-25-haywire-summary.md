# Chat summary — assistant went haywire

Summary:

- The assistant's previous responses became overly verbose and focused on internal tool/process policies rather than giving concise, actionable guidance.
- The user asked for a short, clear summary to capture the interaction for project records.

What happened:

- The conversation included long policy/tool instructions (patch formats, tool usage, code-editing rules).
- This caused confusion and no effective changes or fixes were applied to the codebase as part of that exchange.

Impact:

- Minor wasted time and confusion.
- No code changes or sensitive data exposure detected.

Actions taken:

- User requested a compact summary for the project notebook.
- Assistant produced a concise summary and a copy-paste-ready notebook entry.

Outcome:

- Notebook entry created. No repo edits performed besides adding this summary file.

Next steps:

- Paste this entry into the chosen project notebook if you prefer it in a different file, or keep this file under `docs/chat-summaries/` for historical records.
- If desired, ask the assistant to append this entry to an existing file (specify file path) or to produce a shorter/longer variant.
