This draft PR adds a reproducible Codespace configuration to the repository.

Files added:

- `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` — devcontainer configuration using dotnet 8 image.
- `.devcontainer/postCreate.sh` — idempotent post-create script that installs the Power Platform CLI (pac) using dotnet tools and prints next steps.
- `.devcontainer/create_pr.sh` — helper script to create a branch and draft PR using the GitHub CLI (`gh`).

Notes for reviewers:

- The devcontainer image is intentionally minimal (dotnet 8) to support the Power Platform CLI install. If you prefer a different base image (python, node), suggest alternatives in the review.
- The postCreate script installs pac to the user tool path and ensures PATH is set for the current session. It will skip installation if pac is already present.
- The create_pr helper will commit any local changes and create a draft PR using `gh`. It intentionally requires the user to run it inside the Codespace or a machine with `gh` authenticated.

How to test locally (recommended):

1. Open Codespace from this branch.
2. Let devcontainer build and run postCreate.
3. Open a terminal and run `pac --version` to confirm the CLI is available.
Short summary:

This branch adds initial MCP server scaffold, GitHub workflows to run tests and label indexing, helper scripts for label management, and documentation/artifacts used to generate labels. It also includes a short chat-summary note under docs/chat-summaries to capture a recent assistant interaction.

Key files added (high level):
- .github/workflows/labels-index.yml
- .github/workflows/mcp-tests.yml
- mcp/ (Dockerfile, app, tests, README, requirements)
- scripts/propose_labels_pr.py, scripts/seed-labels.ps1
- docs/GitHub/Colour_Labels_GitHub.xlsx
- docs/chat-summaries/2025-09-25-haywire-summary.md

Notes:
- No production-sensitive secrets are included. The MCP server is a local/dev scaffold intended for testing and documentation.

# Chat summary — assistant went haywire

Summary:

- The assistant's previous responses became overly verbose and focused on internal tool/process policies rather than giving concise, actionable guidance.
- The user asked for a short, clear summary to capture the interaction for project records.

What happened:

- The conversation included long policy/tool instructions (patch formats, tool usage, code-editing rules).
- This caused confusion and no effective changes or fixes were applied to the codebase as part of that exchange.

Impact:

- Minor wasted time and confusion.
- No code changes or sensitive data exposure detected.

Actions taken:

- User requested a compact summary for the project notebook.
- Assistant produced a concise summary and a copy-paste-ready notebook entry.

Outcome:

- Notebook entry created. No repo edits performed besides adding this summary file.

Next steps:

- Paste this entry into the chosen project notebook if you prefer it in a different file, or keep this file under `docs/chat-summaries/` for historical records.
- If desired, ask the assistant to append this entry to an existing file (specify file path) or to produce a shorter/longer variant.
